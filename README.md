## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.

2. Build the project using Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.

3. Run the application.

### Usage
Applying formatting with the buttons must be done by selecting the text first. Hotkeys do not require this, however, so I prefer to use those.

Here is a list of all avaible hotkeys for the application.

| Hotkey          | Action       |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| Ctrl + B        | Bold         |
| Ctrl + I        | Italic       |
| Ctrl + U        | Underline    |
| Ctrl + L        | Align Left   |
| Ctrl + M        | Align Center |
| Ctrl + R        | Align Right  |
| Ctrl + .        | Bullets      |
| Ctrl + S        | Save         |
| Ctrl + O        | Open         |
| Ctrl + N        | New          |
| Ctrl + P        | Print        |
